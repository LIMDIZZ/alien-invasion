# Alien-Invasion (23.10.2022)
My second GitHub project.
I started its developing on October 23 during my reading 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes (my project is the one of three projects in this book).
So these materials gave me the base I've been working with. Making of game really gives me pleasure :)

It's a game called 'Alien Invasion' and it's actually based on Space Invaders (shoot 'em up game released in 1978). There is spaceship which is handled by player
and it can shoot enemies spaceships getting closer to player. The game speed is getting faster with level up. 

The project contains 'audio' and 'images' folders and several files:
• alien.py (alien settings)
• alien_invasion.py (main file of the game, run this file to play the game)
• bullet.py (bullet settings)
• button.py ('Play' button settings)
• game_stats.py (game statistics)
• high_score.json (the highest score is written here)
• scoreboard.py (score information displaying)
• settings.py (game settings)
• ship.py (ship settings)

Besides Eric Matthes's main code base I added backgrounds changing with every new level, music by deathkllr84 and destruction sound for better experience. 
The backgrounds is arranged the way that let me imagine a kind of the plot. This is what I will write next.

THE PLOT:
The far future. There have been no conflicts between the human race and alien beings until a certain time.
However, the aliens declared war on the human race and attacked outer space.
You're the one of the space warriors of International Space Army. There is a world's destiny in your hands.
But now the galaxy space doesn't limit them. Aliens attack the Earth and opens interplanetary gap.
You need to repel their attack on the Earth. Then get inside the gap and clear it of aliens. As it'll be done, destroy as many aliens in the space as you can.


The project's still in process, the new mechanics appear as new ideas come to my mind ;)
